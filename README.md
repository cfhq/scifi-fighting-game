# Space Defense

## Description
You are DEF-01, a robot created by the last united civilizations of the cosmos. Designed to think faster than any being and adapt to any battlefield, your sole directive is simple: protect the universe at all costs.

Alien factions from distant galaxies have begun invading star systems, consuming planets and erasing entire species. As the final line of defense, you are deployed to eliminate these threats before they spread beyond control.

- Inheritance: Character → Player, Enemy
- Polymorphism: Attack() overridden in enemy
